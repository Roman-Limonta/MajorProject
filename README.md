# MajorProject: Story Concept Developer
- **Who is this for**:

    This is for the storyteller. For the writers who have thousands of ideas in their head. For the writers who have writers block because their stuck on the details.
- **What the purpose of the software?**:

    What can we do for you? The program helps storytellers create their ideas from concept to writing. It reminds the writer of the key cruical moments that are in every story. There are key scenes in all stories that storytellers of all mediums need to include. We are here to remind you of them when you are developing your concept.
- **Where and when will the software be used?**:

    The question is... where do you do your best thinking? The program can be used everywhere and anywhere. 
- **How does the software work?**:

    The software works by giving the writer space to develop those key scenes that are in all stories. With a clean and simple UI, the writer does not have to worry about distraction. 
- **Why use this software?**:

    From one write to the next, who not use this software? The best reason to use the software is because of the simple and clean interface. When you have a concept, you don't want to waste try trying to figure out some of these major programs.
